# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to create a more dynamic and informative version of the previously produced UFOs website that filtered simply for date. In this new version users may filter for date, city, state, country, and the shape of the spotted UFO. This allows for the searching of specific entries.

This newer version of the website allows users to refine their searched to gather more detailed and relevant information on UFO spottings. The above image shows the revised and more dynamic version of the website that users may access to view UFO sightings. Due to this revision, users will be able to better access the informationt they are looking for.

## Summary

### Potential Drawbacks
One of the drawbacks of this version of the website is that it does not allow for any potential images of UFO sightings to be uploaded or displayed. A picture is worth a thousand words and in it's current format, this website isnt saying much.

### Additional Recommendations
Going forward one of our recomendations is to code in an avenue for users to view images of the UFO sightings should any exist, and even upload their own images of the sightings that have already been cataloged. This would cast a broader net for UFO sightings as well as encourage the involvment of more individuals in the collection and display of UFO sightings.
Another recommendation would be to include a portal for other UFO spotters to upload their own sighting details and discriptions. This would exponentially increase the amount of data collected and would allow for the site to become a beacon to the UFO spotters of the world.
